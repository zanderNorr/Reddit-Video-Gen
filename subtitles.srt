00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 How does it feel to be fat?

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:15,519
 Unwelcome. Heavy. It feels fucking awful. Sweaty. Get smelly more easily.

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,839
 You're not as flexible without practice. Your penis looks smaller because it's hidden by fat.

4
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,600
 You constantly think about food. You think your life would be perfect if you just lost that weight.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,679
 But you're drawn to sugar and fat and everything bad. You sometimes eat very little when

6
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:39,120
 with other people so that you can gorge later. You hate yourself when you see the double

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,320
 chins. You see people stare at you. You dread booths at restaurants. You know people don't respect

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,160
 you the way they do thin people. You spend half your evenings going to sleep wishing God would

9
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:58,479
 let you die in your sleep because you don't have the guts to do it yourself. Being fat is a

10
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:04,319
 fucking nightmare. I wish I could pay someone to just follow me around all day and slap food out

11
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:12,640
 of my hand. Edit. This is my NSFW account. Please don't click on it. Or you'll see porn. You feel

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,199
 hated by society. That's the worst part of it. Safe in the knowledge I can't be kidnapped.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,120
 It makes you feel bad about yourself and you channel that into your eating.

14
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:32,240
 I'm six feet six and at my heaviest I was 365. I was able to lose 100 pounds over the course of a

15
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,600
 year and I was super proud of myself. But when my died died during C19 my good habits went out

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,920
 the window and I turned back to sugar and food. For comfort, combine that with the fact that I

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:53,280
 had been laid off and wasn't being active I was able to gain 55 pounds. Back in a few months

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:01,120
 I've since lost some weight and I'm at 295 pounds now. And I'm working my way toward 240.

19
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,719
 It's an addiction. In the same way that many people can't get through the day without a few drinks

20
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,680
 or a couple joints. Eating is a way for me to deal with stress. Which I have in abundance because of

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:22,080
 PTSD. It's a mental addiction rather than physical. Sugar however, is definitely physically addictive.

22
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,240
 So much food has sugar in it that it's hard to get away from. Grocery and convenience stores are

23
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,560
 designed to tempt you with candy and chocolate at the front. Counter. The other factor for me

24
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,879
 is the shame and disgust when I look in the mirror I'm reminded that I'm not where I want to be.

25
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,879
 I avoid going to the beach or pool because I don't want to take my shirt off.

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,639
 I don't like running when people can see me because I look like a cube of jello being shaken.

27
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,240
 And every time I have an interaction with someone new my brain tells me that they think I'm

28
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:03,039
 unattractive. I'm a big broad-shouldered guy and after losing so much weight I carry the weight

29
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:10,479
 pretty well. However, the poor self image doesn't go away so easily. Even when I hit my target

30
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:16,879
 that voice will still be in my head. And so will the cravings. It's a constant struggle that

31
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:24,000
 requires willpower and vigilance to overcome. Strangely, other people try to erode that willpower by

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,679
 telling you that you don't need to lose any weight. That they think you look good. That you're not

33
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:36,799
 even that overweight. First my mom when I was growing up. Then my teachers. Then some friends.

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,880
 Now it's society trying to say that being fat isn't a bad thing. That you're no less healthier

35
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,240
 attractive just because you're overweight. Playing up the delusion that if we learn to love and

36
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,880
 accept our fat bodies we won't suffer for it. Down the road. It's bullshit. Just have to keep

37
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,400
 working at it. Sad like your body being a jail that you can't get out easily heartbreak.
