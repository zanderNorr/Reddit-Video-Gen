00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,919
 which real life cheat codes do you know? To save time I sometimes pretend that I'm the dumb one

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:12,640
 that may have made the mistake to avoid the... hole it wasn't my fault conversation. It allows me

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,559
 to take blame and move on to the solution when the solution is all I care about. I don't care

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:25,440
 who's at fault I just need it fixed. If you sleep in the same bed as you're so, don't share a blanket.

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,200
 Each person should have their own blanket. Whichever one it is that helps them sleep the best.

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,079
 Colder or warmer. Comforter versus quilt etc. You'll sleep so much better.

7
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,400
 Cutting out daily drinks with sugar like sodas or frappuccinos really helps with weight loss if you

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,480
 do nothing else. If you're stuck trying to finish or even start something like studying or

9
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:56,000
 working on an assignment. Take a piece of paper and write down your thoughts or anything you're

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,319
 worried about. Once you've got them all. Put the paper away and you should feel more relaxed to

11
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:09,439
 finish what you were doing. Helps a lot of procrastination and anxiety. Don't wait until the person is

12
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:16,479
 dead to tell them how you feel. Whether it's good, bad or indifferent. Once they are gone, it's too

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,760
 late and a huge waste of time obsessing over someone who is no longer here.
